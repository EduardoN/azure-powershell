### Example 1: The RecoverDeletedCertificate operation performs the reversal of the Delete operation.
The operation is applicable in vaults enabled for soft-delete, and must be issued during the retention interval (available in the deleted certificate's attributes).
This operation requires the certificates/recover permission. (autogenerated)
